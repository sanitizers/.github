# Reporting Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security
vulnerabilities.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, fill out a new
vulnerability report via GitHub directly. To do so, follow these instructions:
1. Click on the `Security` tab in the project repository.
2. Click the green `Report a vulnerability` button at the top right corner.
3. Fill in the form as accurately as you can, including as many details as
   possible.
4. Click the green `Submit report` button at the bottom.


## A [Tidelift] Subscriber?

If you prefer to, you may also report a security vulnerability through the
[Tidelift security contact]. [Tidelift] will coordinate the fix and disclosure.
This is not the maintainers' first preference, though. Please, use the GitHub's
vulnerability reporting option, whenever possible.
